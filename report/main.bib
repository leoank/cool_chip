  abstract = {In the present work, the geometry optimization of a longitudinal fin with volumetric heat generation is investigated. Heat is transferred by conduction along the fin and dissipated from the surface via natural convection to the ambient and radiation to the surrounding. The aim of the design problem is to maximize the fin heat loss for a given volume of fin. The design problem is reduced to an optimization problem for finding the positions of control points which represent the B-spline curves. The modified genetic algorithm is used to maximize an objective function that its maximum corresponds to the optimum fin profile. The effects of the base temperature, the variable convective heat transfer coefficient, the surface emissivity, and the volumetric heat generation on the fin profile, temperature distribution along the fin length, and the fin efficiency are investigated numerically.}

The bidimensional temperature distribution on the longitudinal section of the fin is calculated by resorting to the finite elements method. The heat flux dissipated by a generic profile fin is compared with the heat flux removed by the rectangular profile fin with the same length and volume. The genetic algorithm is then applied to the case of polynomial profile fins, in order to determine the polynomial parameter values which optimize the fin effectiveness. The optimum profile is finally shown for different polynomial orders.}

  abstract = {In the present paper, a plate and fin heat exchanger is considered and air, as an ideal gas, is defined in both sides of the heat exchanger as the working fluid. Several geometric variables within the logical constraints are considered as optimization parameters. Two different objective functions including the total rate of heat transfer and the total annual cost of the system are defined. Since mentioned objectives are conflicting, no single solution can well-satisfy both objective functions simultaneously. In other words, any attempt to increase the value of the total rate of heat transfer leads to the higher total cost of the system which is certainly undesirable. Therefore, multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm is utilized in order to achieve a set of optimal solutions, each of which is a trade-off between objectives and can satisfy both objective functions in an appropriate level. The main advantage of this work is providing a set of optimal solutions each of which can be selected by the designer based on the project’s limits and the available investment. A sensitivity analysis is also presented in order to investigate the effect of some geometric parameters on each objective functions.}

Thereafter, the fin profile is optimized by means of multi-objective genetic algorithm which aims to find geometries that maximize the heat transfer and, at the same time, minimize the hydraulic resistance. The geometry of the fins is parameterized by means of a polynomial function and several order are investigated and compared.}

The results of a theoretical study of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids with copper nanophase materials are presented, the potential benefits of the fluids are estimated, and it is shown that one of the benefits of nanofluids will be dramatic reductions in heat exchanger pumping power.},
