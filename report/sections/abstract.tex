In recent years,
the heat fluxes from electronics became very high (with peak values of 103W/cm2)
and in the near future with 3D electronic system design,
the volumetric density of heat to be removed will become even higher.\sidecite{Herwig2013}
It presents great challenges to thermal management.
Many studies have investigated various heat transfer enhancement techniques to solve these challenges.\sidecite{Siddique_2010}
Within the scope of this project, we explored three of these techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimization of fin profile
    \item Optimization of microchannel topology
    \item Use of nanofluids
\end{itemize}

First, we procedurally generated fin profiles using a scripting cad, CADQuery\sidecite{adam_urbanczyk_2020_4362562}.
Similarly,  we also generated microchannel topologies.
Then we created an automatic pipeline to perform thermal numerical simulations on the generated models.
Finally,  we performed fluid-thermal coupling numerical simulations to assess heat transfer improvements due to the use of nanofluids together with optimized fin profiles and microchannel topology.
